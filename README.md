# Purpose

This repository gives an instructional walk-through on "what needs to done" to be able to automate VMware SD-WAN product on  vRealize Automation 8.0. 

As of today only the virtual VeloCloud Edge (vVCE) is covered and I am planning to add VeloCloud Orchestrator (VCO) and VeloCloud Gateway (VCG) in the future (when time permits).

I would start with the blueprint first, to get an overview what has been done and work my way forward from there.
