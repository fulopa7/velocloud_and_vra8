# Introduction

Blueprints represent the most important entity within vRealize Automation â€“ they define how to provision and manage the lifecycle of resources in vRealize Automation (aka, infrastrucutre as a code).
In this section, we will go deeper on the different sections of the blueprint and why we configure those for the VCE.

# Useage

By going to Cloud Assembly->Blueprints->Upload, you should be able to upload the ``template.yaml`` with the given name and towards project you defined previously. In my case, I called it "vVCE Blueprint" and upload it to project called "Tests".

# Overview of the Blueprint

After uploading and opening the blueprint you will see that vRA has constructed a topology based on the definition of the YAML and the sections in between it.
