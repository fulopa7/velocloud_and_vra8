# Introduction

Blueprints represent the most important entity within vRealize Automation â€“ they define how to provision and manage the lifecycle of resources in vRealize Automation (aka, infrastrucutre as a code).In this section, we will go deeper on the different sections of the blueprint and why we configure those for the VCE.

In summary the main objectives of this blueprint:
- Create the VCE within vSphere and create 6 interfaces.
  - Those 6 interfaces must be configured towards the right networks (done via constraints).
  - Associate right compute resources on VCO.
- Create an input form for variables we need for provisioning the VCE itself and the automation of register the VCE onto the VCO. 

# Useage

By going to "Cloud Assembly"->"Blueprints"->"Upload", you should be able to upload the ``template.yaml`` with the given name and towards project you defined previously. In my case, I called it "vVCE Blueprint" and upload it to project called "Tests".

# Overview of the Blueprint

After uploading and opening the blueprint you will see that vRA has constructed a topology based on the definition of the YAML. 

<p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/Blueprint_Overview.png" width="1024"></p>

The below will describe the template and each section of the YAML.

## Inputs Section in YAML

The input section in the "Blueprint" provides the end-user the option to enter values, so the Blueprint can consume those. When the Blueprint gets shared in "Service Broker" under catalog, the end-user using that Blueprint gets a input form onto which he/she is asked to input the values needed for the Blueprint.

Those inputs can also be tested in the "Blueprint" itself when by performing a "Test"

<p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/Blueprint_Testing.png" width="1024"></p>

The "Blueprint" can consume those variables because vRA8 creates an object called `input` and associates the variables defined as attributes within that object. Lets consider what I have done, as an example how it works.

```yml 
...
inputs:
  host:
    type: string
    encrypted: false
    description: VCO IP or Hostname
    default: vco22-fra1.velocloud.net
    title: VCO Host
  code:
    type: string
    encrypted: false
    description: Activation code on VCO
    title: Activation Code
    default: GENERATE
  password:
    type: string
    encrypted: true
    title: Password on vVCE
    description: Password for vVCE to access via ssh
    default: Velocloud123
...
```

`host`, `code` and `password` are variables which I defined in this case, so they can be used later in the template via `${input.host}`, `${input.code}`, `${input.password}` respectively. Those variables have properties associated to them: 
- `type` to provide vRA8 the context of the variable, such that, the end-user input form can be created accordingly. Other types are number, integer, Boolean, or object 
- `default` to provide a prepopulated value for that variable.
- `description` to provide a help text to the end-user on the input form.
- `title` to provide a friendly name on the  end-user input form for that variable (provides better user expierence).

In this case, those variables have been created to pass towards the VCE to successfully activate against a VCO and to provison the VCE with a default password. In addition, the variable `code` will also be used in "Extensibility" to check if the activation code needs to be generated (aka, VCE was not created first on the VCO) or use the provided activation code for the VCE. With this ability full automation can be archived, that is, a VCE can be created on compute host and created on VCO at the same time.   

Under the section [Extensibility](../extensibility/) the notation on "how we check the activation code" and "how we get activation code from VCO after creating the VCE in VCO" will be elaborated but for now please refer to [Resources](#Resources-Section-in-YAML) to understand "how we use these variables in the Blueprint and pass those to the VCE itself". 

For more information on how inputs can be customised please refer to [How user input can customize a vRealize Automation Cloud Assembly blueprint
](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Automation/8.0/Using-and-Managing-Cloud-Assembly/GUID-6BA1DA96-5C20-44BF-9C81-F8132B9B4872.html)

## Resources Section in YAML

The resource section gives one the possiblity to define the compute resources, the networks they should use and the connections between resources and the defined networks, vRA8 should provision and configure. In this template, I defined a compute resource called `vVCE` which is a `type: Cloud.vSphere.Machine` onto which I will connect 6 interfaces to, use the OVA image and send via ovfProperties some values such that the [cloud-init within the VCE](https://github.com/iddocohen/vce_cloudinit/) can use it.  

For a more meaningful topology, one could extend this template to add several compute resources and attach those via networking to the `vVCE` - that is not shown here.

In this section I will elaborate the properties of the compute resources and the networks as well.
